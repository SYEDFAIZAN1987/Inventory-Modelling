![Inventory Modelling](https://github.com/SYEDFAIZAN1987/Inventory-Modelling/blob/main/pic%201.jpg)

## 📘 About the Project

This project focuses on creating a **prescriptive decision model** to assist a manufacturing company in optimizing inventory management for a key engine component. The objective is to minimize total inventory costs by balancing **holding costs**, **ordering costs**, and **economic order quantity (EOQ)**. The analysis is conducted using **Excel** and **R**, providing a comprehensive solution to inventory optimization challenges.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

1. **Develop Mathematical Models**:
   - Compute annual holding and ordering costs.
   - Formulate a total inventory cost model.

2. **Determine Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**:
   - Calculate the optimal order quantity and frequency to minimize total costs.

3. **Implement Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Explore the impact of varying parameters like demand, order costs, and holding costs.

4. **Verify Results with Solver**:
   - Use **Excel Solver** to validate the mathematical model and optimize the total cost.

## 📊 Key Results

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
- **Annual Demand**: 15,000 units
- **Order Cost**: $220 per order
- **Holding Cost**: $14.40 per unit/year
- **EOQ**: 677 units
- **Annual Total Cost**: $9,748.85

### Insights
- **Optimal Order Frequency**: 22.16 orders per year.
- **Balanced Costs**: Holding and ordering costs are minimized at $4,874.43 each.
- **Validation**: Results verified using Excel Solver and sensitivity analysis.
